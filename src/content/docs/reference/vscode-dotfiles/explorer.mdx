"explorer.autoReveal": true,
// Configure paths or [glob patterns](https://aka.ms/vscode-glob-patterns) for excluding files and folders from being revealed and selected in the Explorer when they are opened. Glob patterns are always evaluated relative to the path of the workspace folder unless they are absolute paths.

    "**/node_modules": true,

// - `${capture}`: Matches the resolved value of the `*` from the parent pattern
// - `${basename}`: Matches the parent file's basename, the `file` in `file.ts`
// - `${extname}`: Matches the parent file's extension, the `ts` in `file.ts`
// - `${dirname}`: Matches the parent file's directory name, the `src` in `src/file.ts`
// - `*`:  Matches any string, may only be used once per child pattern

// Controls which naming strategy to use when giving a new name to a duplicated Explorer item on paste.
//  - simple: Appends the word "copy" at the end of the duplicated name potentially followed by a number.
//  - smart: Adds a number at the end of the duplicated name. If some number is already part of the name, tries to increase that number.

//  - default: Uppercase and lowercase names are mixed together.
