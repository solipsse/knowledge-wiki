The relative path must include the WORKSPACE_FOLDER (e.g `WORKSPACE_FOLDER/src/**.tsx` or `*/src/**.tsx`). Absolute patterns must start with a `/`. In case multiple patterns match, the longest matching path will be picked. Each __Value__ is the template for the rendered editor when the __Item__ matches. Variables are substituted based on the context:
// - `${dirname}`: name of the folder in which the file is located (e.g. `WORKSPACE_FOLDER/folder/file.txt -> folder`).
// - `${dirname(N)}`: name of the nth parent folder in which the file is located (e.g. `N=2: WORKSPACE_FOLDER/static/folder/file.txt -> WORKSPACE_FOLDER`). Folders can be picked from the start of the path by using negative numbers (e.g. `N=-1: WORKSPACE_FOLDER/folder/file.txt -> WORKSPACE_FOLDER`). If the __Item__ is an absolute pattern path, the first folder (`N=-1`) refers to the first folder in the absolute path, otherwise it corresponds to the workspace folder.
// - `${filename}`: name of the file without the file extension (e.g. `WORKSPACE_FOLDER/folder/file.txt -> file`).
// - `${extname}`: the file extension (e.g. `WORKSPACE_FOLDER/folder/file.txt -> txt`).
// - `${extname(N)}`: the nth extension of the file separated by '.' (e.g. `N=2: WORKSPACE_FOLDER/folder/file.ext1.ext2.ext3 -> ext1`). Extension can be picked from the start of the extension by using negative numbers (e.g. `N=-1: WORKSPACE_FOLDER/folder/file.ext1.ext2.ext3 -> ext2`).
//
